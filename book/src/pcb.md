## PCB

The PCB design is located in the `hardware` folder and was created using KiCad. It is a two-layer layout based on the Rust ESP Board. This design removes unused sensors from the original board and adds the necessary components for this project.



## Status
Currently, the PCB has not yet been manufactured, so it remains untested.
